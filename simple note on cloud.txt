Features of instances in AWS
AMI(Amzon Machine Images)
Instance Types
Key Pairs
Instance Storage Volume
Amazon EBS(Elastic Block store) Volumes
Security Groups
Elastic IP addresses
VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)

EBS Volumes (Elastic Block Storage) -Raw block level storage that can be attached to EC2
EBS Snapshot is used to backup data from EBS volumes to S3 by taking intime snapshot

AWS Lambda
It is a serverless compute service
APP Building
Execute the backend code by automatically managing the AWS resources.
The code that you want Lambda to run is known as Lambda function.
Event sourceis the entity which trigger a Lambda function.

Limitations of AWS lambda:
Hardware specific Limitation

AWS S3
S3 is secure because 
client side encryption
server side encryption
provides versioning
S3 is durable
oject will be the fundamental entity in S3
data will be the fundamental entity in S3
data which is accessed not that frequently
amazon S3 standard for frequently data acess
amazon S3 standerd for infrequent data
amazon glacier
bucket is a logical unit in S3 containing objects which contain data and metadata.
